===============================================
---------------------------------------------
HELLO FLASK PEEPS,here's my first project...!
---------------------------------------------
I'm writing a simple web micro application in Flask framework, for "USER 
LOFIN FORM"
STEPS:
1-USER LOGIN FORM
2-NEW-USER CAN REGISTER,with his credentials,which are stored in MYSQL 
DATABASE
3-On succesful registration, SMTP protocal is used to send 
"valid-url-link" to the registered mail address
4- RE-REGISTRATION isnt allowed with checks done in username and emailid
fields of databases 
5-On entering "valid-url-link" received from email 
,his temporary password is stored in permanent password field in MYSQLdatabase and 
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES REGISTRATION
6-NOW USER CAN LOGIN,WITH CORRECT CREDENTIALS ENTERED,HE/SHE IS 
WELCOMED otherwise error message is displayed.!
